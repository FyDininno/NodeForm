# Node Form

Node Form is an addon for Blender that allows you to turn a mathematical transformation into an animation. It can also be used as a program to simply transform geometries for other applications which are not animation related. It works through a node-based UI which resides in the 'Geometry Nodes' panel of an invisible scene object named 'Node Form'.
